# Power Types
### __To quote the Origins documentation:__
Power Types are what grants functionality to your origins! Each power has a type, specified with
a `type` field in the JSON. Which type a power is defines which other fields it requires and supports.


!!! note

    Unless stated otherwise, each power type supports a `condition` field that can check for [Entity Condition Types](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types/entity_condition_types/). See [Power JSON](https://origins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/json/power/) for more details.
