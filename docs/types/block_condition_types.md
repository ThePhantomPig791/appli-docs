# Block Condition Types
### __To quote the Origins documentation:__
Block Condition Types operate on `CachedBlockPosition`, essentially a combination of `World` and `BlockPos`, which allows retrieving all necessary information about the block. These are available to power/condition types that provides a `block_condition` object field.
