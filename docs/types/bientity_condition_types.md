# Bi-entity Condition Types
### __To quote the Origins documentation:__
Bi-entity Condition Types operate on a Pair<Entity, Entity>, or in simpler terms: an actor and a target. The actor and target is determined depending on the used power type, and can be swapped. These are available to power/condition types that provides a bientity_condition object field.
